# Getting Started!

This is a simple tutorial on how to get moving with `deno-blog-starter`.

## Install Deno and `deno-blog-starter`

Make sure that you have [installed Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno_install).
Then, install `deno-blog-starter` by executing the following command:

`deno install --unstable https://deno.land/x/dbs/mod.ts`

## Create your First Blog-Post ‚ú®

Once you have successfully installed Deno and `deno-blog-starter`, you can create your first blog-post.
To create your first post, run the following command:

`dbs --new-post`

Expect to see a file of the format `posts/post_#####.md` in the [`posts`](../posts) directory.
Edit the contents and name of that file to write the most beautiful markdown document of all time.

Rename the file to `my-first-post.md`.

## Build your Blog üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Your blog is ready to be built.
To build your blog, run the following command:

`dbs --build`

A new directory (`site`) has been generated, containing the static site itself.

## Preview your Blog üì°

Now that your blog has been built, it can now viewed in the browser.
To preview the site, run the following command:

`dbs --serve`

And now, the blog-post that you renamed is visible at [``]().
